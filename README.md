Note: When user first signs up, the app will crash. This is because the database is not recognized. Go to the file named db.php and remove the parameter for the connection that has the database name. Rerun the webapp and then you will get another error saying no database selected. After that, re-add the database parameter and the webapp will run perfectly.
